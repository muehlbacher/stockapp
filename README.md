### TRADINGAPP

This app is all about analyzing the long term competitive advantage of a company.
The purpose of this app is to understand:
1. How do you identify and exceptional company with a durable competitive advantage?
2. How do you value a company with a durable competitive advantage?

We will use the financial statements to put this into practice.

This application does not fit if you want to speculate on the stock market.
Its for value investors. The purpose is to find exceptional companies for the long run.
We try to find the companies with some kind of "competitive advantage" that create a monopoly like market.

This "super" companies come in three basic business models:
    1. They sell a unique product,
    2. they sell a unique service,
    3. are the low-cost provider of a product or service that the public consistently needs.

1. Selling a unique product:
    The brands of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Wrigley, Hershey, Budweiser, Coors, Kraft, The Washington Post, Procter & Gamble, and Philip Morris have successfully embedded their stories in our minds through customer needs, experiences, and advertising. As a result, these companies have conditioned us to think of their products when we seek to fulfill specific needs. For instance, when you crave gum, Wrigley comes to mind; after a long day at work, Budweiser is your go-to beer; and of course, "things go better with Coke."

    These companies have secured a place in the consumer's mind, and once they own that space, they don’t need to constantly innovate their products, which, as you’ll see, is a great advantage. This mental ownership also allows them to charge higher prices and increase sales, generating positive economic effects that are clearly reflected in their financial statements.

2. Selling a unique service:

    This is the domain of companies like Moody's Corp., H&R Block Inc., American Express Co., The ServiceMaster Co., and Wells Fargo & Co. These companies, similar to lawyers or doctors, provide services that people need and are willing to pay for. However, unlike lawyers and doctors, these companies are institutionally specific, rather than people specific. For example, when you think about getting your taxes done, you think of H&R Block—not of Jack, the individual who does your taxes there. In people-specific firms, employees have the leverage to demand and receive a significant portion of the firm's earnings, which leave a much smaller pot for the firm's owner/shareholders. Getting a smaller pot is most of the time bad. 
    The economics of selling a unique service can be very profitable. The company does not have to spend money on redising products, production plants and warehousing. Firms that sell a unique service that owns part of the conumser minds cna make better margins then firms selling products

3. Low-cost buyer and seller of a product or service that the public has an ongoing need for:

    Wal-Mart, Costco, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheims's Jewelers, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. Big margins are traded for volume. So the increase in volume makes up for the decrease in margin. The key is to be both low-cost buyer and low-cost seller, which allows you to get your margins higher than your competitor's and still be the low-cost seller of a product or a service. The story of being the best price in town becomes part of the consumer's story of where to shop.

So a simple rule: Sell a unique product or service or be the low-cost buyer and seller of a product or service, and you get to cash in, year after year, just as though you broke the bank at Monte Carlo.


Second important rule is consistency. Is the profit consistent are the other indicators showing consistency? This shows a "durability" in the competitive advantage. 

Financial Statements:
- Income Statement: How much the company earned during a set period of time. The companies accountants traditionally make them for shareholders for each three-month period during the fical year and for the whole fiscal year.
- Balance Sheet: The balance sheet tells us how much money the company has in the bank and how much money it owes. The money in the bank subtracted by the money owed is the net worth of the company. A balance sheet can be create for any given the day of the year.
- Cash Flow Statement: this tracks the cash that flows in and out of the company. It is good to see how much money the company is spending on capital improvements. Also tracks bond and stock sales and repurchases.



## The Income Statement
Three basic components:
- Revenue of the business
- Expenses of the business
- Profit or loss (revenue - expenses)

# Income Statement
- Revenue: Its the first indicator you should look at.  If we are manfucatoring jeans and we sell $120 million worth of jeans in a year, we will report $120 million of total revenue for the year on your yearly income statement.
A lot of revenue doesn't mean the company is making any profit. To determine if a company is earning a profit, you need to deduct the expenses of the business from its total revenues. revenue - expenses = net earnings
