### TRADINGAPP

This app is all about analyzing the long term competitive advantage of a company.
The purpose of this app is to understand:
1. How do you identify and exceptional company with a durable competitive advantage?
2. How do you value a company with a durable competitive advantage?

We will use the financial statements to put this into practice.

This application does not fit if you want to speculate on the stock market.
Its for value investors. The purpose is to find exceptional companies for the long run.
We try to find the companies with some kind of "competitive advantage" that create a monopoly like market.

This "super" companies come in three basic business models:
    1. They sell a unique product,
    2. they sell a unique service,
    3. are the low-cost provider of a product or service that the public consistently needs.

1. Selling a unique product:
    The brands of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Wrigley, Hershey, Budweiser, Coors, Kraft, The Washington Post, Procter & Gamble, and Philip Morris have successfully embedded their stories in our minds through customer needs, experiences, and advertising. As a result, these companies have conditioned us to think of their products when we seek to fulfill specific needs. For instance, when you crave gum, Wrigley comes to mind; after a long day at work, Budweiser is your go-to beer; and of course, "things go better with Coke."

    These companies have secured a place in the consumer's mind, and once they own that space, they don’t need to constantly innovate their products, which, as you’ll see, is a great advantage. This mental ownership also allows them to charge higher prices and increase sales, generating positive economic effects that are clearly reflected in their financial statements.

2. Selling a unique service:
